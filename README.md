# Venice Canal: Gondola Adventures

**Venice Canal: Gondola Adventures** lets you explore the world of gondolas through the power of Java classes!

**Goal:**  
Simulate and customize real-life gondolas and their gondoliers using object-oriented programming, showcasing how code can reflect real-world objects and their interactions.

**What to expect:**  
When you run the program, you’ll see gondolas with unique attributes—capacity, material, color, speed—operated by dynamic gondoliers. Try actions like loading passengers, rowing, turning, and switching operators, all shown as clear console output.

**What makes it unique:**  
This project brings both the gondola and its operator to life, allowing you to change their properties and see instant, realistic updates. It’s a creative blend of object interaction and customization, making OOP concepts vivid and engaging!
